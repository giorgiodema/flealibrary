ActionController::UnknownFormat (AdsController#new is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/users_list/8/bann_user".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

   @request.env["devise.mapping"] = Devise.mappings[:user]

Un Dostoevskij lirico, ispirato, comincia a riflettere sulle disillusioni dell’esistenza e dell’amore nell’ultima opera pubblicata prima dell’arresto e della deportazione, esperienze che modificheranno in maniera radicale e definitiva la sua concezione dell’uomo e dell’arte. In questa edizione, al celebre racconto viene affiancata la visione “diurna” di Pietroburgo contenuta nei feuilletons che compongono la Cronaca di Pietroburgo, vero e proprio laboratorio per la scrittura dostoevskiana. Lo stretto legame tra pubblicistica e letteratura, che accompagnerà Dostoevskij negli anni della maturità, viene così a manifestarsi fin quasi dal suo esordio. Il racconto Le notti bianche ha ispirato il film omonimo di Luchino Visconti (1957), con Marcello Mastroianni e Maria Schell, e il film Quattro notti di un sognatore di Robert Bresson (1971).", "imageLinks"=>{"smallThumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z_6rCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z_6rCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "industryIdentifiers"=>[{"identifier"=>"9788858820742", "type"=>"ISBN_13"}, {"identifier"=>"8858820746", "type"=>"ISBN_10"}], "infoLink"=>"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z_6rCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "language"=>"it", "maturityRating"=>"NOT_MATURE", "pageCount"=>"176", "panelizationSummary"=>{"containsEpubBubbles"=>"false", "containsImageBubbles"=>"false"}, "previewLink"=>"http://books.google.it/books?id=z_6rCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Notti+bianche&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "printType"=>"BOOK", "publishedDate"=>"2015-04-29T00:00:00+02:00", "publisher"=>"Feltrinelli Editore", "readingModes"=>{"image"=>"true", "text"=>"true"}, "title"=>"Le notti bianche - La cronaca di Pietroburgo"}}}}
