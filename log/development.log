Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).

Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).

Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).

Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).

VERSIONE EBOOK RIVEDUTA E CORRETTA. 30/01/2017: - ripristinati i paragrafi alla fine di \"Molti incontri\" (Libro secondo, Capitolo I); - ripristinato nel frontespizio il testo in lettere Feanoriane e Cirth; - ripristinata e migliorata la formattazione del testo; - resi interattivi i rimandi interni; - aumentata la risoluzione di alcune immagini e corretto l'orientamento; - modificata la struttura dell'indice interattivo; - rimossi diversi refusi. 23/10/17: - aggiornate copertina e pagina di presentazione. Un mondo sul ciglio dell'abisso, un pugno di eroi capaci di opporsi al male. Una pietra miliare della letteratura di tutti i tempi. Avventure in luoghi remoti e terribili, episodi di inesauribile allegria, segreti paurosi che si svelano a poco a poco, draghi crudeli e alberi che camminano, città d'argento e di diamante poco lontane da necropoli tenebrose in cui dimorano esseri che spaventano al solo nominarli, urti giganteschi di eserciti luminosi e oscuri. Tutto questo è Il Signore degli Anelli, leggenda e fiaba, tragedia e poema cavalleresco, romanzo d’eccezione al di fuori del tempo, semplice e sublime.", "imageLinks"=>{"smallThumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2qSgDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2qSgDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "industryIdentifiers"=>[{"identifier"=>"9788858705827", "type"=>"ISBN_13"}, {"identifier"=>"8858705823", "type"=>"ISBN_10"}], "infoLink"=>"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2qSgDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "language"=>"it", "maturityRating"=>"NOT_MATURE", "pageCount"=>"1221", "panelizationSummary"=>{"containsEpubBubbles"=>"false", "containsImageBubbles"=>"false"}, "previewLink"=>"http://books.google.it/books?id=2qSgDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=il+signore+degli+anelli&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "printType"=>"BOOK", "publishedDate"=>"2012-11-28T00:00:00+01:00", "publisher"=>"Giunti", "readingModes"=>{"image"=>"true", "text"=>"true"}, "title"=>"Il Signore degli Anelli"}}, "list_type"=>"1"}}

Un mondo sul ciglio dell'abisso, un pugno di eroi capaci di opporsi al male. Una pietra miliare della letteratura di tutti i tempi. Avventure in luoghi remoti e terribili, episodi di inesauribile allegria, segreti paurosi che si svelano a poco a poco, draghi crudeli e alberi che camminano, città d'argento e di diamante poco lontane da necropoli tenebrose in cui dimorano esseri che spaventano al solo nominarli, urti giganteschi di eserciti luminosi e oscuri.

La vicenda dei due protagonisti ha assunto nel tempo un valore simbolico, diventando l'archetipo dell'amore perfetto ma avversato dalla società.

Per anni hanno viaggiato inseguendo terapie: tradizionali, sperimentali, spirituali. Adesso partono per un viaggio diverso, senza bussola e senza meta. Insieme, padre e figlio, uniti nel tempo sospeso della strada. Tagliano l'America in moto, si perdono nelle foreste del Guatemala. Per tre mesi la normalità è abolita, e non si sa più chi è diverso. Per tre mesi è Andrea a insegnare a suo padre ad abbandonarsi alla vita. Andrea che accarezza coccodrilli, abbraccia cameriere e sciamani. E semina pezzetti di carta lungo il tragitto, tenero Pollicino che prepara il ritorno mentre suo padre vorrebbe rimanere in viaggio per sempre.", "imageLinks"=>{"smallThumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OfJ8tgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OfJ8tgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "industryIdentifiers"=>[{"identifier"=>"8871686144", "type"=>"ISBN_10"}, {"identifier"=>"9788871686141", "type"=>"ISBN_13"}], "infoLink"=>"http://books.google.it/books?id=OfJ8tgAACAAJ&dq=se+ti+abbraccio+non+aver+paura&hl=&source=gbs_api", "language"=>"it", "maturityRating"=>"NOT_MATURE", "pageCount"=>"319", "previewLink"=>"http://books.google.it/books?id=OfJ8tgAACAAJ&dq=se+ti+abbraccio+non+aver+paura&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "printType"=>"BOOK", "publishedDate"=>"2012", "ratingsCount"=>"2", "readingModes"=>{"image"=>"false", "text"=>"false"}, "subtitle"=>"il viaggio di Franco e Andrea", "title"=>"Se ti abbraccio non aver paura"}}, "list_type"=>"0"}}

La malattia di Andrea è un uragano, sette tifoni. L'autismo l'ha fatto prigioniero e Franco è diventato un cavaliere che combatte per suo figlio. Un cavaliere che non si arrende e continua a sognare. Per anni hanno viaggiato inseguendo terapie: tradizionali, sperimentali, spirituali. Adesso partono per un viaggio diverso, senza bussola e senza meta. Insieme, padre e figlio, uniti nel tempo sospeso della strada. Tagliano l'America in moto, si perdono nelle foreste del Guatemala. Per tre mesi la normalità è abolita, e non si sa più chi è diverso. Per tre mesi è Andrea a insegnare a suo padre ad abbandonarsi alla vita. Andrea che accarezza coccodrilli, abbraccia cameriere e sciamani. E semina pezzetti di carta lungo il tragitto, tenero Pollicino che prepara il ritorno mentre suo padre vorrebbe rimanere in viaggio per sempre.", "imageLinks"=>{"smallThumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OfJ8tgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OfJ8tgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "industryIdentifiers"=>[{"identifier"=>"8871686144", "type"=>"ISBN_10"}, {"identifier"=>"9788871686141", "type"=>"ISBN_13"}], "infoLink"=>"http://books.google.it/books?id=OfJ8tgAACAAJ&dq=se+ti+abbraccio+non+aver+paura&hl=&source=gbs_api", "language"=>"it", "maturityRating"=>"NOT_MATURE", "pageCount"=>"319", "previewLink"=>"http://books.google.it/books?id=OfJ8tgAACAAJ&dq=se+ti+abbraccio+non+aver+paura&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "printType"=>"BOOK", "publishedDate"=>"2012", "ratingsCount"=>"2", "readingModes"=>{"image"=>"false", "text"=>"false"}, "subtitle"=>"il viaggio di Franco e Andrea", "title"=>"Se ti abbraccio non aver paura"}}, "list_type"=>"1"}}

Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).

Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).
