Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).

Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano). L'opera è dedicata a Léon Werth, ma a quando era un bambino.", "imageLinks"=>{"smallThumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ht4KDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ht4KDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "industryIdentifiers"=>[{"identifier"=>"9781507170649", "type"=>"ISBN_13"}, {"identifier"=>"1507170645", "type"=>"ISBN_10"}], "infoLink"=>"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ht4KDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "language"=>"it", "maturityRating"=>"NOT_MATURE", "pageCount"=>"289", "panelizationSummary"=>{"containsEpubBubbles"=>"false", "containsImageBubbles"=>"false"}, "previewLink"=>"http://books.google.it/books?id=Ht4KDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT35&dq=il+piccolo+principe&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "printType"=>"BOOK", "publishedDate"=>"2017-02-01", "publisher"=>"Babelcube Inc.", "readingModes"=>{"image"=>"true", "text"=>"true"}, "title"=>"Il Piccolo Principe"}}, "list_type"=>"1"}}

Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).

Instead, our goal is to bring a diverse set of software engineering topics together into a single narrative, help readers understand the most important ideas through concrete examples and a learn-by-doing approach, and teach readers enough about each topic to get them started in the field. Courseware for doing the work in the book is available as a virtual machine image that can be downloaded or deployed in the cloud. A free MOOC (massively open online course) at saas-class.org follows the book's content and adds programming assignments and quizzes.

ActionController::UnknownFormat (HomeController#show_profile is missing a template for this request format and variant.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

Anche se in apparenza sono persone molto diverse: lei insegna filologia medievale all’università, lui è un popolare giornalista sportivo che parla spesso di calcio in televisione. Non hanno avuto figli, ma proprio questa mancanza ha finito per rendere ancora più solido e sereno il loro legame. Finché un’ombra non inizia a offuscare la mente di Lino. All’inizio solo momentanei cali d’attenzione, poi vuoti di memoria sempre più ampi e preoccupanti. È a quel punto che inizia la seconda vita di Chicca e Lino, un nuovo amore. Con le sue storie e i suoi personaggi, Pupi Avati sta tracciando uno straordinario autoritratto del nostro paese e del nostro tempo, rivelatore e commovente, tra costume e sentimenti, tra attualità e memoria. Il protagonista di Una sconfinata giovinezza, Lino, perde il contatto con il mondo che lo circonda ma trova rifugio nella lontana memoria dell’infanzia, nelle sue emozioni e nei suoi profumi. E Pupi Avati, nel raccontare una vicenda che affronta temi di drammatica urgenza, ci sa emozionare e sorprendere.", "imageLinks"=>{"smallThumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CzgkXW5B2TkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CzgkXW5B2TkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "industryIdentifiers"=>[{"identifier"=>"9788811131885", "type"=>"ISBN_13"}, {"identifier"=>"881113188X", "type"=>"ISBN_10"}], "infoLink"=>"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CzgkXW5B2TkC&source=gbs_api", "language"=>"it", "maturityRating"=>"NOT_MATURE", "pageCount"=>"160", "panelizationSummary"=>{"containsEpubBubbles"=>"false", "containsImageBubbles"=>"false"}, "previewLink"=>"http://books.google.it/books?id=CzgkXW5B2TkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=sconfinata+giovinezza&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "printType"=>"BOOK", "publishedDate"=>"2010-12-31T00:00:00+01:00", "publisher"=>"Garzanti", "readingModes"=>{"image"=>"true", "text"=>"true"}, "title"=>"Una sconfinata giovinezza"}}, "list_type"=>"2"}}

Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).

Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).

Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).

Pubblicato contemporaneamente in inglese e in francese nel 1943 a New York. È uno scritto poetico e filosofico sotto le mentite spoglie di fiaba per bambini. La lingua, semplice e poco articolata perché destinata a essere compresa da un pubblico infantile, risulta il mezzo privilegiato dal narratore per trasmettere una concezione simbolica della vita. Ogni capitolo analizza un incontro del Piccolo Principe, il quale lo lascia perplesso riguardo l'assurdo comportamento dei grandi. Ognuno di questi incontri può essere letto in chiave allegorica. Gli acquerelli sono parte integrante del testo e contribuiscono alla purezza del linguaggio: la leggerezza e la profondità sono le principali qualità di quest'opera e vi si può leggere un chiaro invito dell'autore a ritrovare il bambino che è in ognuno di noi, perché tutti i grandi sono stati prima di tutto dei bambini (ma in pochi se lo ricordano).
